High-scalability keystore
                                                                        

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I'm not aware of any specific cryptographic concept or system referred to as "High-scalability keystore cryptography" (HSK cryptography). It's possible that new developments or technologies have emerged since then, or that the term is specific to a certain domain or organization.

In general, "high scalability" refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work or data in a graceful and efficient manner. A "keystore" is a secure repository that stores cryptographic keys and certificates. Combining these concepts could imply a cryptographic system designed to handle a high volume of keys and cryptographic operations in a scalable manner.

If this is a term or concept that has been introduced or gained prominence after my last update, I recommend checking the latest academic papers, industry publications, or official documentation related to cryptography and key management for the most up-to-date information on "High-scalability keystore cryptography."
